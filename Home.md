Effe een tabelletje:
 TYPE             | ASCII                        | HTML              
 -----------------| ---------------------------- | ------------------
 Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' 
 Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" 
 Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash 

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables | Are | Cool |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
